(* Objective:

This lab is intended to get you up and running with the course's
assignment submission system, and thinking about core concepts
introduced in class, including:

    * concrete versus abstract syntax
    * atomic types
    * first-order functional programming

Part 0: Testing your Gradescope Interaction

Labs and problem sets in CS51 are submitted using the Gradescope
system. By now, you should be set up with Gradescope.

........................................................................
Exercise 1: To make sure that the setup works, submit this file,
just as is, under the filename "lab1.ml" to the Lab 1 assignment on
the CS51 Gradescope web site.
........................................................................

When you submit labs (including this one) Gradescope will check that the
submission compiles cleanly, and if so, will run a set of unit tests on
the submission. For this part 0 submission, most of the unit tests will
fail (as you haven't done the exercises yet). But that's okay. We won't
be checking the correctness of your labs until the "virtual quiz" this
weekend. See the syllabus for more information about virtual quizzes,
our very low stakes method for grading labs.

Now let's get back to doing the remaining exercises so that more of
the unit tests pass.

     *******************************************************************
     By the way, we use the commenting convention in our code
     throughout the course that code snippets within comments are
     demarcated with backquotes, for instance, `x + 3` or `fun x ->
     x`. You can think of this as corresponding to the fixed-width
     font in the textbook.
     *******************************************************************

........................................................................
Exercise 2: So that you can see how the unit tests in labs work,
replace the `failwith` expression below with the integer `42`, so that
`exercise2` is a function that returns `42` (instead of failing). When
you submit, the Exercise 2 unit test should then pass.
......................................................................*)

let exercise2 () = 42 ;;

(* From here on, you'll want to test your lab solutions locally before
submitting them at the end of lab to Gradescope. A simple way to do that
is to cut and paste the exercises into an OCaml interpreter, such as
utop, which you run with the command

    % utop

You can also use the more basic version, ocaml:

    % ocaml

We call this kind of interaction a "read-eval-print loop" or
"REPL". Alternatively, you can feed the whole file to OCaml with the
command:

    % ocaml < lab1.ml

to see what happens. We'll introduce other methods soon. *)

(*======================================================================
Part 1: Concrete versus abstract syntax

We've distinguished concrete from abstract syntax. Abstract syntax
corresponds to the substantive tree structuring of expressions,
concrete syntax to the particulars of how those structures are made
manifest in the language's textual notation.

In the presence of multiple operators, issues of precedence and
associativity become important in constructing the abstract syntax
from the concrete syntax.

........................................................................
Exercise 3: Consider the following abstract syntax tree:

     ~-
      |
      |
      -
      ^
     / \
    /   \
   5     3

that is, the negation of the result of subtracting 3 from 5.  To
emphasize that the two operators are distinct, we've used the concrete
symbol `~-` (a tilde followed by a hyphen character, an alternative
spelling of the negation operation; see the Stdlib module) to notate
the negation.

How might this be expressed in the concrete syntax of OCaml using the
fewest parentheses? Replace the `failwith` expression with the
appropriate OCaml expression to assign the value to the variable
`exercise3` below.
......................................................................*)

let exercise3 () = ~- (5 - 3) ;;

(* Hint: The OCaml concrete expression `~- 5 - 3` does *not*
correspond to the abstract syntax above.

........................................................................
Exercise 4: Draw the tree that the concrete syntax `~- 5 - 3` does
correspond to. Check it with a member of the course staff.
......................................................................*)

(* SOLUTION: The abstract syntax of the OCaml expression `~- 5 - 3`
   has the subtraction as the primary operator, nesting the negation
   of 5 and 3 as left and right children respectively, thus,

      -
      ^
     / \
    /   \
   ~-    3
   |
   |
   5

 *)

(*......................................................................
Exercise 5: Associativity plays a role in cases when two operators
used in the concrete syntax have the same precedence. For instance,
the concrete expression `2 + 1 + 0` might have abstract syntax as
reflected in the following two parenthesizations:

    2 + (1 + 0)

or

    (2 + 1) + 0

As it turns out, both of these parenthesizations evaluate to the same
result (`3`).

Construct an expression that uses an arithmetic operator twice, but
evaluates to two different results dependent on the associativity of
the operator. Use this expression to determine the associativity of
the operator. Check your answer with a member of the course staff if
you'd like.
......................................................................*)

(* SOLUTION: We need to use an operator that, unlike `+` and `*`, is
   not associative. Examples include `-` and `/.` For instance,

   # (3 - 2) - 1 ;;
   - : int = 0
   # 3 - (2 - 1) ;;
   - : int = 2
 *)

(*======================================================================
Part 2: Types and type inference

........................................................................
Exercise 6: What are appropriate types to replace the ??? in the
expressions below? Test your solution by uncommenting the examples
(removing the `(*` and `*)` at start and end) and verifying that no
typing error is generated.
......................................................................*)

let exercise6a : int = 42 ;;

let exercise6b : string =
  let greet y = "Hello " ^ y
  in greet "World!";;

(* If you were confused about what the `^` operator does, you'd have
   found it in the Stdlib module described in the OCaml
   documentation online. *)

let exercise6c : float -> float  =
  fun x -> x +. 11.1 ;;

let exercise6d : int -> bool =
  fun x -> x < x + 1 ;;

let exercise6e : int -> float -> int =
  fun x -> fun y -> x + int_of_float y ;;

(* The reasoning for exercise6e goes something like this: The argument

   of the function is `x`, which returns another function, with a
   second argument `y`. The value of `y` is an argument of the
   `int_of_float` function, which takes a a float argument, so `y`
   must be a float. The value of `x`, as argument of interger `+`,
   must be an `int`. Thus the top-level function takes `x`, an `int`,
   and `y`, a `float`, to the result of integer addition, an `int`,
   that is, `int -> float -> int`. *)

(*======================================================================
Part 3: First-order functional programming

For warmup, here are some "finger exercises" defining simple functions
before moving onto more complex problems.

........................................................................
Exercise 7: Define a function `square` that squares its
argument. We've provided a bit of template code, supplying the first
line of the function definition but the body of the skeleton code just
causes a failure by forcing an error using the built-in failwith
function. Edit the code to implement `square` properly.

Test out your implementation of `square` by modifying the template
code below to define `exercise7` to be the `square` function applied
to the integer 5. You'll want to replace the `0` with the correct
function call.

Thorough testing is important in all your work, and we hope to impart
this view to you in CS51. Testing will help you find bugs, avoid
mistakes, and teach you the value of short, clear, testable
functions. In the file lab1_tests.ml, we’ve put some prewritten tests
for `square` using the testing method of Section 6.5 in the
book. Spend some time understanding how the testing function works and
why these tests are comprehensive. You may want to add some tests for
other functions in the lab to get some practice with automated unit
testing.
......................................................................*)

let square (x : int) : int  =
  x * x ;;

let exercise7 =
  square 5 ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 8: Define a function, `exclaim`, that, given a string,
"exclaims" it by capitalizing it and suffixing an exclamation mark.
The String.capitalize_ascii function may be helpful here. For example,
you should get the following behavior:

   # exclaim "hello" ;;
   - : string = "Hello!"
   # exclaim "Ciao" ;;
   - : string = "Ciao!"
   # exclaim "what's up" ;;
   - : string = "What's up!"
......................................................................*)

let exclaim (text : string) : string =
  (String.capitalize_ascii text) ^ "!" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 9: Define a function, `small_bills`, that determines, given a
price, if one will need a bill smaller than a 20 to pay for the
item. For instance, a price of 100 can be paid for with 20s (and
larger denominations) alone, but a price of 105 will require a bill
smaller than a 20 (for the 5 left over after the 100 is paid). We will
assume (perhaps unrealistically) that all prices are given as integers
and (more realistically) that 50s, 100s, and larger denomination bills
are not available. In addition, you may assume all prices given are
non-negative.

   # small_bills 105 ;;
   - : bool = true
   # small_bills 100 ;;
   - : bool = false
   # small_bills 150 ;;
   - : bool = true
......................................................................*)

let small_bills (price : int) : bool =
  let cutoff_size = 20 in
  (price mod cutoff_size) <> 0 ;;

(* Note the use of `<>` for inequality. You may have used `==` or `!=`
   for comparing integer values for equality or inequality. OCaml
   distinguishes two kinds of equality comparisons: *structural* and
   *physical* equality. More on the distinction later in the course
   (Section 15.1.2 in the textbook for the interested), but for now,
   it is sufficient to note that you should be using the *structural*
   equality operators: `=` for equality and `<>` for inequality. These
   differ from the operators in C and Python (which use `==` and
   `!=`), which are used as the physical equality operators in OCaml.

   We also labeled 20 our `cutoff_size`. It is generally good practice
   to name special numbers used in code. If used many times, they
   should be defined only in one location, so that changing them is
   easy, but even if used only once, explicit naming provides for
   better documentation. See the style guide section on "Constants and
   magic numbers". *)

(*......................................................................
Exercise 10:

The calculation of the date of Easter, a calculation so important to
early Christianity that it was referred to simply by the Latin
"computus" ("the computation"), has been the subject of
innumerable algorithms since the early history of the Christian
church.

The algorithm to calculate the Computus function is given in Problem
30 in the textbook, which you'll want to refer to.

Write two functions that, given a year, calculate the month
(`computus_month`) and day (`computus_day`) of Easter in that year via
the Computus function.

In 2018, Easter took place on April 1st. Your functions should reflect
that:

   # computus_month 2018;;
   - : int = 4
   # computus_day 2018 ;;
   - : int = 1
......................................................................*)

(* SOLUTION: You might have implemented a `computus_month` function like
   this:

    let computus_month (year : int) : int =
      let a = year mod 19 in
      let b = year / 100 in
      let c = year mod 100 in
      let d = b / 4 in
      let e = b mod 4 in
      let f = (b + 8) / 25 in
      let g = (b - f + 1) / 3 in
      let h = (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) mod 30 in
      let i = c / 4 in
      let k = c mod 4 in
      let l = (32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k) mod 7 in
      let m = (a + 11 * h + 22 * l) / 451 in
      (h + l - 7 * m + 114) / 31 ;;

   and then just made a copy and modify it to form the `computus_day`
   function:

    let computus_day (year : int) : int =
      let a = year mod 19 in
      let b = year / 100 in
      let c = year mod 100 in
      let d = b / 4 in
      let e = b mod 4 in
      let f = (b + 8) / 25 in
      let g = (b - f + 1) / 3 in
      let h = (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) mod 30 in
      let i = c / 4 in
      let k = c mod 4 in
      let l = (32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k) mod 7 in
      let m = (a + 11 * h + 22 * l) / 451 in
      (h + l - 7 * m + 114) mod 31 + 1 ;;

   However, the first twelve equations are shared between the
   computations for the month and the day, so it makes sense to split
   this common part out as its own function: *)

let computus_common (year : int) : int =
  let a = year mod 19 in
  let b = year / 100 in
  let c = year mod 100 in
  let d = b / 4 in
  let e = b mod 4 in
  let f = (b + 8) / 25 in
  let g = (b - f + 1) / 3 in
  let h = (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) mod 30 in
  let i = c / 4 in
  let k = c mod 4 in
  let l = (32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k) mod 7 in
  let m = (a + 11 * h + 22 * l) / 451 in
  h + l - 7 * m + 114 ;;

(* The `computus_month` and `computus_day` functions can then be
   implemented on the basis of that common calculation. *)

let computus_month (year : int) : int =
  (computus_common year) / 31 ;;

let computus_day (year : int) =
  (computus_common year) mod 31 + 1 ;;

(* Even more redundancy can be eliminated in the computation by taking
   advantage of structured data, coming up in the next lab. You might
   note that many of the equations come in pairs -- b and c, d and e,
   i and k, and even the final two calculations of the month and year --
   with one of the equations a division (`x / y`), and the other the
   remainder of that division (`x mod y`). By defining a function to
   calculate both of these values, and returning them as a pair, we can
   eliminate this redundancy, and reduce the possibility that a change to
   one of the pairs doesn't get reflected in the other.

    let divmod (x : int) (y : int) : int * int =
      x / y, x mod y ;;

    let computus_common (year : int) : int * int =
      let a = year mod 19 in
      let b, c = divmod year 100 in
      let d, e = divmod b 4 in
      let f = (b + 8) / 25 in
      let g = (b - f + 1) / 3 in
      let h = (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) mod 30 in
      let i, k = divmod c 4 in
      let l = (32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k) mod 7 in
      let m = (a + 11 * h + 22 * l) / 451 in
      let month, previous_day = divmod (h + l - 7 * m + 114) 31
      in month, previous_day + 1 ;;

    let computus_month (year : int) : int =
      fst (computus_common year) ;;

    let computus_day (year : int) : int =
      snd (computus_common year) ;;

  Exercise to the reader: Why is the below implementation not ideal?

    let computus_month (year : int) : int =
      let january = year mod 19 in
      let february = year / 100 in
      let march = year mod 100 in
      let april = february / 4 in
      let may = february mod 4 in
      let june = (february + 8) / 25 in
      let july = (february - june + 1) / 3 in
      let august = (january * 19 + february - april - july + 15) mod 30 in
      let september = march / 4 in
      let october = march mod 4 in
      let november = (32 + 2 * may + 2 * september - august - october) mod 7 in
      let december = (january + 11 * august + 22 * november) / 451 in
      (august + november - 7 * december + 114) / 31 ;;
 *)

Part 4: Code review

A frustrum (see Figure 6.3 in the textbook) is a three-dimensional
solid formed by slicing off the top of a cone parallel to its
base. The formula for the volume of a frustrum in terms of its radii
and height is given in the textbook as well.

As an experienced programmer at Frustromco, Inc., you've been assigned
to mentor a beginning programmer. Your mentee has been given the task
of implementing a function `frustrum_volume` to calculate the volume
of a frustrum. Here is your mentee's stab at this task:

(* frustrum_volume -- calculate the frustrum *)
let frustrum_volume a b c =
  let a =
  let s a = a * a in
  let h = b in 3.1416
  *. h /. float_of_int 3*. (a *.
  a +. c  *.  c+.a *. c) in a
;;

As this neophyte programmer's mentor, you're asked to perform a code
review on this code. You test the code out on an example -- a frustrum
with radii 3 and 4 and height 4 -- and you get

   # frustrum_volume 3. 4. 4. ;;
   - : float = 154.985599999999977

which is (more or less) the right answer. Nonetheless, you have a
strong sense that the code can be considerably improved. *)

(*......................................................................
Exercise 11: Go over the code with your lab partner, making whatever
modifications you think can improve the code, placing your revised
version just below. Once you've converged on a version of the code
that you think is best, call over a staff member and go over your
revised code together.
......................................................................*)

(*** Place your revised version here within this comment. ***)

(* During the code review, your boss drops by and looks over your
proposed code. Your boss thinks that the function should be compatible
with the header line given at <https://url.cs51.io/frustrum>. You
agree.

........................................................................
Exercise 12: Revise your code to make sure that it uses the header
line given at <https://url.cs51.io/frustrum>.
......................................................................*)

(*** Place your updated revised version below, *not* as a comment,
     because we'll be unit testing it. (The two lines we provide are
     just to allow the unit tests to have something to compile
     against. You'll want to just delete them and start over.) ***)
(* SOLUTION: There are, of course, lots of problems with the original
   code; it's almost completely unreadable and obscure. Let's start by
   at least adding white space -- line breaks and indentation -- to
   make the structure of the function clear:

   let frustrum_volume a b c =
     let a =
       let s a = a * a in
       let h = b in
       (3.1416 *. h /. float_of_int 3)
       *. (a *. a +. c *. c + .a *. c) in
     a ;;

   That's already much better. It makes more clear that the radii are
   `a` and `c` and the height is `b`. (Maybe that's why the programmer has
   the `let h = b` renaming.) Better variable names are badly needed,
   as well as a better order for arguments. (That'll allow for
   dropping the `let h = b`, too.) We should also mark the intended
   types for the arguments and for the return value:

   let frustrum_volume (radius1 : float)
                       (radius2 : float)
                       (height : float)
                     : float =
     let a =
       let s a = a * a in
       (3.1416 *. height /. float_of_int 3)
       *. (radius1 *. radius1 +. radius2 *. radius2 +. radius1 *. radius2) in
     a ;;

   Now, what is this local function `s` that is being defined? It looks
   like a squaring function, which might have been useful in calculating
   the squares of the radii, but apparently that idea got dropped. We can
   drop the definition as well. The code also defines the answer in a
   local variable `a` (for answer?), which it just returns. There's no
   reason to name the return value in that way.

   let frustrum_volume (radius1 : float)
                       (radius2 : float)
                       (height : float)
                     : float =
     (3.1416 *. height /. float_of_int 3)
     *. (radius1 *. radius1 +. radius2 *. radius2 +. radius1 *. radius2) ;;

   The squaring can be better implemented with the `**` exponentiation
   operator, and we might as well order the three terms in the more
   standard way (as shown in the equation in the textbook):

   let frustrum_volume (radius1 : float)
                       (radius2 : float)
                       (height : float)
                     : float =
     (3.1416 *. height /. float_of_int 3)
     *. (radius1 ** 2. +. radius1 *. radius2 +. radius2 ** 2.) ;;

   Notice the "magic number" (see the style guide section on
   "Constants and magic numbers") `3.1416`. That's presumably intended
   to be pi. But we can make that intention clearer (and slightly more
   accurate) by using a constant for pi. In fact, OCaml provides a
   defined constant for pi in the Float library, `Float.pi`. Finally,
   we can update the documentation to make this all clearer as well.

   In the end, the code review process converges on the following: *)

(* frustrum_volume radius1 radius2 height -- Returns the volume of a
   conical frustrum given the radii of the two faces ( `radius1` and
   `radius2`) and the perpendicular `height` *)

let frustrum_volume (radius1 : float)
                    (radius2 : float)
                    (height : float)
                  : float =
  (Float.pi *. height /. 3.)
  *. (radius1 ** 2. +. radius1 *. radius2 +. radius2 ** 2.) ;;

(* Compare this with the original code above. Vast improvement, no? *)

Part 5: Utilizing recursion

........................................................................
Exercise 13: The factorial function takes the product of an integer
and all the integers below it. It is generally notated as !. For
example, 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. Write a function, factorial, that
calculates the factorial of an input. Note: the factorial function is
generally only defined on non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). For
the purpose of this exercise, you may assume all inputs will be
non-negative.

For example,

   # factorial 4 ;;
   - : int = 24
   # factorial 0 ;;
   - : int = 1
......................................................................*)

let rec factorial (x : int) =
  if x = 0 then 1
  else x * factorial (x - 1) ;;

  (* The above code is what we expected people to produce.  However,
     this code will run forever when the input is negative. Better
     practice would be to raise an error, as below, when we encounter
     an invalid input. You'll learn more about this issue in Lab 4.

     let rec factorial (x : int) =
        if x < 0 then raise (Invalid_argument "input must be non-negative")
        else if x = 0 then 1
        else x * factorial (x - 1) ;;
   *)

(*......................................................................
Exercise 14: Define a recursive function `sum_from_zero` that sums all
the integers between 0 and the input, inclusive.

   # sum_from_zero 5 ;;
   - : int = 15
   # sum_from_zero 100 ;;
   - : int = 5050
   # sum_from_zero ~-3 ;;
   - : int = -6

(The sum from 0 to 100 was famously if apocryphally performed by
the mathematician Carl Freiedrich Gauss as a seven-year-old, *in his
head*!)
......................................................................*)

(* Here's an approach that works recursively. The recursive cases for
   positive and negative numbers are handled separately, since in the
   former case we want to count down (using the built-in `pred`
   function) and for negatives we want to count up toward zero (using
   `succ`). *)

let rec sum_from_zero (x : int) : int =
  if x = 0 then 0
  else if x < 0 then x + sum_from_zero (succ x)
  else x + sum_from_zero (pred x) ;;

(* You may notice that there's a lot of similarity between the `then`
   and `else` branches. We could factor out the similarities by
   narrowing the scope of the conditional test inside, and use it just
   for selecting whether to use the function `succ` or `pred`. The
   result is this:

    let rec sum_from_zero (x : int) : int =
      if x = 0 then 0
      else x + sum_from_zero (if x < 0 then succ x else pred x) ;;

   or even this

    let rec sum_from_zero (x : int) : int =
      if x = 0 then 0
      else x + sum_from_zero ((if x < 0 then succ else pred) x) ;;

   The latter, frankly, may be taking things too far. It's a bit too
   "cute".

   In this exercise, we were explicitly looking for this recursive
   solution. However, there's a closed-form solution for the sum, the
   one that Gauss himself used (see Figure 14.6 in Chapter 14 of the
   textbook), that we can use to generate the following non-recursive
   version.

    let sum_from_zero (x : int) : int =
      (x * (succ (abs x))) / 2 ;;

   (Do you see why this also works for the negative cases?) *)
